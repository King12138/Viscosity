   make.right.greaterThanOrEqualTo(self.view, multiplier: 2, offset: 0)
   make.height.lessThanOrEqualTo(30)
   make.bottom.equalTo(self.view, offset: -30)
 }
```

   make.left.equalTo(self.view.vis_right, offset: -300)
 }
```

   make.right.equalTo(self.view, offset: -300)
   make.bottom.equalTo(self.view, offset: -30)
 }
```
